# Sav-e.
**An Australian Supermarket Price Comparision Application for iOS.**

## Helping Australians decide where to shop at.
Sav-e allows shoppers to easily see which supermarket sells their favourite products cheaper. Items from supermarkets can be selected and compared from, then added to a shopper's shopping list for easy viewing. 

The main view, Shopping List, clearly shows the cheapest prices and where shoppers can get it from, using colour coding as a guide.

Aussies can also see which shops are closest to them using the find shops near me function.

If there's a disount of more than 40% from one of the stores, the app will send a notification to shoppers to alert them of the special deal. 

If there aren't any direct alternatives to the product from another supermarket, Sav-e allows shoppers to pick whatever is closest to that product for comparison of prices.

## Current Supported Supermarkets.
- Woolworths
- IGA

Support for other supermarkets isn't planned for now

## Background.
This project was initially a part of a university project done in about 2 months. I may want to continue developing the application in the future to support mroe supermarkets and features.

## Unfinished Stuff.
To begin, I've always had in mind to compare the two giants, Woolworths and Coles. Unfortunatly, since I'm working with API endpoints, the process becomes a lot more... difficult to say the least. Fortunatly, Woolworths has clear and distinct pattern and actual structure to their APIs, whereas Coles is very... robust, quering with their API is very difficult and with the time constraints I had at the time, I wasn't able to figure out why the API was so bad and how to implement it into the app; it was simply easier to just give up and go for another supermarket's API (IGA in this case).

The UI is quite clean and clear but could probably do with some improvements as well.

At some point I was also looking into push notifications. this would allow for the notification of any special deals based on previous prices i.e. new price is more than 30% off the original price. This would most likely involve web services which was out of scope.

If you're more experienced than me feel free to give it a try. The supermarket websites are only accessable in Australia I belive, so it might prove a little difficult for those overseas.

I have no current plans to release this on the Apple App Store.
