# Sav-e.
**An Australian Supermarket Price Comparision Application for iOS.**

## Helping Australians decide where to shop.
Sav-e allows shoppers to easily see which supermarket sells their favourite products cheaper. Items from supermarkets can be selected and compared, then added to a shopper's shopping list for easy viewing. 

The main view, the Shopping List, clearly shows the cheapest prices and where shoppers can get it from, using colour coding as a guide.

Aussies can also see which shops are closest to them using the find shops near me function.

If there's a discount of more than 40% from one of the stores, the app will notify shoppers to alert them of the special deal. 

Sav-e allows shoppers to pick whatever is closest to that product to compare prices if there aren't any direct alternatives to the product from another supermarket.

## Current Supported Supermarkets.
- Woolworths
- IGA

Support for other supermarkets isn't planned for now

## Background.
This project was initially part of a university project in about 2 months. I may want to continue developing the application in the future to support mroe supermarkets and features.

## Unfinished Stuff.
To begin, I've always considered comparing the two giants, Woolworths and Coles. Unfortunately, since I'm working with API endpoints, the process becomes a lot more... difficult, to say the least. Fortunately, Woolworths has clear and distinct patterns and actual structure to their APIs, whereas Coles is very... robust. Quering with their API is very difficult, and with the time constraints I had at the time, I couldn't figure out how to implement it into the app; it was simply easier to give up and go for another supermarket's API (IGA in this case).

The UI is quite clean and clear but could probably do with some improvements.

At some point, I was also looking into push notifications. this would allow for the notification of any special deals based on previous prices, i.e., the new price is more than 30% off the original price. This would most likely involve web services, which was out of scope.

I have no current plans to release this on the Apple App Store.
